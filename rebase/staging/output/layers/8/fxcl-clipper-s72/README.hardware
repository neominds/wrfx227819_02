4.1.2 Specify boot medium
-------------------------

The ROM bootloader loads the secondary bootloader from the start or the first
partition of the selected device and executes it, which is indeed a BOOT.BIN
image that encapsulates the FSBL and u-boot properly.

Please refer to the 3.1.1 and 3.2.2 section of the README file for the details
about preparing the secondary bootloader on the MMC/SD card and QSPI Flash
respectively.
